# final_project
BMI 6018 Final
Synopsis
This is a modified version of the classic retro arcade game Snake. This version uses the Pygame module as the game engine.  Using the arrow keys to move the snake as you attempt to eat the mouse, with each mouse eaten the snake grows by one segment.  If the snake hits itself it's game over and you can choose to play again for another chance. The scores are saved with your name and score into a file named snake.json.  These may be viewed to see which person has the highest score. The program requires Pygame, Pygame_TextInput https://github.com/Nearoo/pygame-text-input, and the rest of the modules are in the standard Python library.

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation
This is a final project for a programming class. I decided to create and modify this classic game so that I could visually see the changes that I had made to the code and how those changes affected the program in real time.  This visual approach helped me to understand state machine coding and game loops for player movement generation.  I plan to continue to update with new features as I improve my coding skills. 

Installation
Pygame is required found here: http://pygame.org
Pygame_textinput is required found here: https://github.com/Nearoo/pygame-text-input
Pandas is required and found here: https://pandas.pydata.org/
The rest of the modules are found in the standard Python library.

API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors
Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
