Snake Game Final Project


BMI 6018 Final

Synopsis

This is a modified version of the classic retro arcade game Snake. This version uses the Pygame module as the game engine.  Using the arrow keys to move the snake as you attempt to eat the mouse, with each mouse eaten the snake grows by one segment.  If the snake hits itself it's game over and you can choose to play again for another chance. The scores are saved with your name and score into a file named snake.json.  These may be viewed to see which person has the highest score. The program requires Pygame, Pygame_TextInput https://github.com/Nearoo/pygame-text-input, and the rest of the modules are in the standard Python library.

Motivation

This is a final project for a programming class. I decided to create and modify this classic game so that I could visually see the changes that I had made to the code and how those changes affected the program in real time.  This visual approach helped me to understand state machine coding and game loops for player movement generation.  I plan to continue to update with new features as I improve my coding skills. 

Installation

Pygame is required found here: http://pygame.org

Pygame_textinput is required found here: https://github.com/Nearoo/pygame-text-input

Pandas is required and found here: https://pandas.pydata.org/

The rest of the modules are found in the standard Python library.

Usage

Using the arrow keys on the keyboard move the snake around the screen and try to eat the mouse.  Every time the snake eats the mouse it gains a segment and the game is over when you collide with a segment.  The space bar, w, p, q, and m keys are used for various controls in the game that are explained on screen.
